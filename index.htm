This Massimo Dutti's collection has a wide range of sizes to offer a perfect fit for every silhouette.There are different types of jackets that come together under the same leitmotif: elegance. From a comfortable cotton jacket to an iconic leather jacket, each garment exudes the unmistakable signature of Massimo Dutti.Among the more casual retro looks is the iconic leather bomber jacket. This piece has been crafted with an elevated style in mind, making it distinctive yet easy to wear alongside many different ensembles. Perfect for layering with both warm and light, casual or more sophisticated looks, or worn over jumpers and sweatshirts, it accentuates its dynamic look and creates an outfit ready for any occasion. When paired over a shirt or blouse, the bomber jacket adds an edge to professional attires.One design that maintains its status as a must-have in any wardrobe —whether it's for men or women— is the leather biker jacket. Its bold design is surprisingly versatile, and in fact, the leather jacket is equally at home with delicate dresses, fine accessories and high-heeled sandals, as it is with suit trousers and basic T-shirts. It's more contemporary interpretation, the oversized biker jacket, is perfect for wearing over skirts and slim-fit dresses, creating a harmonious balance of silhouettes.Practicality and sophistication merge in functional designs without losing any style. The down quilted jacket is that option that always rises to the occasion, no matter how cold it gets. On a sportier side, the hooded version of the quilted jacket adds an even more casual element that makes it the perfect disruptive tool to any formal look.On the more stylish side of warmer garments, we have two essential pieces.

The use of premium leather makes the brand's leather jacket an excellent investment, as it is the only way to guarantee unsurpassed durability and feel. However, the use of the best leather must go hand in hand with a design to match. This is why the collection also makes the most of classic silhouettes as is evident in the flattering leather trench coat with its characteristic belt or the must-have blazers in this luxurious fabric; which are perfect for pairing with the most elegant garments and shoes in any wardrobe.\n\nThe collection covers every style, from the clean-lined fur coat tailored for a minimalist aesthetic to a women's biker jacket with a lapel collar and zips for a look that's as striking as it is refined. Women's leather jackets remain one of the most popular items of clothing season after season, a feat that is no coincidence. The concept has the potential to solve almost any look and has that universal charm that's impossible to resist. In addition, it can adopt a variety of design details with great fluidity, including materials such as sheepskin. As well as elevating the warmth of a look, the sheepskin jacket also proves that, when it comes to distinction, subtlety is always the smartest strategy.\n\nLong versions also claim their place in this selection in the form of the fur trench coat, with its traditional design for a timeless look. As a rule, all coats that come down below the thigh add a sumptuous touch to the styling, as shown by the long fur coat. While this piece not only stands out for its ability to keep you warm on colder days, it also exudes a natural elegance thanks to the brand's aesthetic codes. And when it comes to short down jackets, the quilted fur jacket never disappoints, whether it tops off a jumper and jeans look or over an exquisite silk strapless dress.\n\nHalfway between a shirt and a jacket, the leather overshirt has earned its place in the spotlight. An essential in a woman's wardrobe, this garment can be worn over shirts, jumpers, party tops and even with nothing underneath. Under Massimo Dutti's watchful eye the overshirt is transformed into a delicate and feminine option, and our leather designs are no exception.","keywords":null,"key":"WOMEN_V_FAM_JACKETS_LEATHER","numberOfProducts":null,"type":"22","viewCategoryId":0,"subcategories":[],"attachments":[{"id":"554453","name":"FORCE_VIEW_6","path":"FORCE_VIEW_6","type":"LABEL"},{"id":"554951","name":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","path":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","type":"LABEL"}],"sequence":44,"oldIds":[],"categoryUrl":"women/jackets/leather-n1452","categoryUrlTranslations":[],"seoCategory":{"name":"Leather Jackets","title":"Leather Jackets for Women","metaDescription":"Women's leather jackets add the right amount of style to any look.

Long coats, including the popular women's trench coat, are designed to cover a greater percentage of the body than jackets, and that naturally translates into a warmer feeling when it matters most.Functionality is one of the pillars on which the Massimo collection is based, while elegance is undoubtedly another. Together these two virtues reach their maximum expression in a sophisticated variety of long coats, including the cosmopolitan women's trench coat, the femininity of a belted coat or a distinguished double-breasted coat.While the trench coat in wool or other fabrics has become an essential piece in a woman's wardrobe thanks to its exceptional flair, this issue features other equally appealing garments. One of the most structured options is the crossover coat, an ideal concept for both everyday and elegant occasions. Women's sailor coats, characterised by a navy blue crossover design, are a favourite choice in any situation. When finished off with luxurious metallic buttons, this style is a winning bet for important appointments on your day-to-day life.Whereas in concepts such as the sailor coat or the trench coat, the button fastening takes on a heavyweight in the design, alternatives such as the smock coat are a great option for those who prefer a clean-lined silhouette. Its single-button fastening is concealed beneath a feminine lace-up belt which not only allows for a customised fit, but also serves to add an elegant touch to the look.In terms of fabrics, Massimo Dutti's selection prioritises the highest quality, resulting in garments that can be called upon season after season. The range of materials ranges from the classic women's wool coat to a sumptuous women's fur coat and a women's fur coat to ensure that premium touch to any outfit.The brand's premium women's coat naturally adopts a variety of styles and alternates classic shades with colours whose vibrancy can be used to great effect to liven up sober outfits. Thus, the colour palette of the collection offers models in black, navy blue and beige, but also makes room for long coats in other colours such as purple, orange and green.

This Massimo Dutti's collection has a wide range of sizes to offer a perfect fit for every silhouette.There are different types of jackets that come together under the same leitmotif: elegance. From a comfortable cotton jacket to an iconic leather jacket, each garment exudes the unmistakable signature of Massimo Dutti.Among the more casual retro looks is the iconic leather bomber jacket. This piece has been crafted with an elevated style in mind, making it distinctive yet easy to wear alongside many different ensembles. Perfect for layering with both warm and light, casual or more sophisticated looks, or worn over jumpers and sweatshirts, it accentuates its dynamic look and creates an outfit ready for any occasion. When paired over a shirt or blouse, the bomber jacket adds an edge to professional attires.One design that maintains its status as a must-have in any wardrobe —whether it's for men or women— is the leather biker jacket. Its bold design is surprisingly versatile, and in fact, the leather jacket is equally at home with delicate dresses, fine accessories and high-heeled sandals, as it is with suit trousers and basic T-shirts. It's more contemporary interpretation, the oversized biker jacket, is perfect for wearing over skirts and slim-fit dresses, creating a harmonious balance of silhouettes.Practicality and sophistication merge in functional designs without losing any style. The down quilted jacket is that option that always rises to the occasion, no matter how cold it gets. On a sportier side, the hooded version of the quilted jacket adds an even more casual element that makes it the perfect disruptive tool to any formal look.On the more stylish side of warmer garments, we have two essential pieces. On the one hand, the quilted bomber jacket has been designed to add a subtle edge to any casual look, similar to the feel of the quilted leather jacket. On the other hand, the quilted lined jacket exudes strength and personality, making it perfect to wear with delicate, feminine pieces thanks to the contrasting styles and fabrics.Massimo Dutti's women's jackets not only fulfil their function as outerwear, but they also have the power to elevate any look thanks to their perfect design and the quality of their materials.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"Stylish, essential and waterproof jackets for women","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":1961030,"name":"Leather","nameEn":"Leather","shortDescription":"View all","description":"In Massimo Dutti's leather selection for women, you will find elegant and modern designs materialised into high-quality pieces to complement your style and elevate it to a higher level of sophistication.

These classics are complemented by other styles such as the Perkins collar jumper and the turtleneck jumper. To achieve the effortless look so popular with the most stylish French women, simply pair a blazer with a turtleneck jumper, straight or denim trousers and loafers and let accessories do the rest.One of the biggest challenges that this garment often faces is warmth, therefore this collection features a variety of chunky knitted jumpers.

A knitted jumper with openwork details can be the epitome of femininity, especially when combined with delicate and minimalist accessories, such as small earrings and fine rings to stylise the look.The striped knitted jumper is a safe bet for creating sophisticated looks with a chic touch. It also pairs well with denim, whether it's a pair of jeans or a denim skirt.

Another option —which is without a doubt one of the best examples of this aesthetic— is the knitted waistcoat.

Massimo Dutti's designs transcend the typical women's cardigan, transforming it into an element that exudes delicacy and even a hint of sensuality without compromising the classic essence of the basic cardigan.\n\nThe selection includes different lengths to suit all styles. The cropped cardigan sits low on the waist accentuating this part of the body and is ideal for slightly loose-fitting, high-waisted trousers. The comfortable oversize cardigan, which is a sure hit for everyday wear, is an excellent match for slim-fit or skinny trousers. In between the two extremes, the classically cut wool cardigan with luxurious gold buttons is also a versatile piece that goes naturally with a wide range of outfits, including the most delicate dresses.\n\nCombining different textures undoubtedly enriches any look and enhances its appeal. Massimo Dutti has kept this aspect in mind when designing its cardigans, whether it's a short cardigan or a long cardigan. Fur cardigans, for example, are emerging as a source of elegance and warmth for the colder months. However, the range of textures in the collection doesn't stop there: you can also find models in a curly knit with an exceptional texture as well as braided knit versions that double up as a buttoned pullover for the office thanks to their fitted shape.\n\nOne need only glance at the range of cardigans on offer to conclude that this garment has set out to be at home in any situation, even the most special. And its argument in favour of a party look is undeniable: replacing the button fastening with a crossover design in ballerina style and finishing the design with a bow that enhances the femininity even more. Along these lines, it's only natural that Massimo Dutti's crossover knitted cardigan would do well paired with shiny, high-heeled outfits that are sure to make a statement.\n\nAnd, for the warmer months, the knitted waistcoat is a sleeveless design that can be worn on its own, like a jumper, despite the central button fastening. In bright colours full of optimism, the collection's wool waistcoat is a tribute to Massimo Dutti's unwavering commitment to using only the finest materials, season after season.","keywords":null,"key":"WOMEN_V_FAM_CARDIGANS","numberOfProducts":null,"type":"22","viewCategoryId":0,"subcategories":[{"id":2166873,"name":"Cárdigans Rayas","nameEn":"Cárdigans Rayas","shortDescription":null,"description":"By bringing that extra warmth and elegance to any look, the cardigan is crowned as one of the most relevant garments to current times.

Made with sophisticated fabrics that comes with a variety of colours, perfect to fit your own style.","mainHeader":"Jumpers for women","longDescription":"Like other classic garments, the jumper was originally a practical piece which has been refined to become a must-have in womenswear collections. This season's new jumper focuses on the quality of the fabric for greater comfort and durability.Massimo Dutti's edit presents impeccable designs suitable for a number of sophisticated outfits, from the timelessly elegant gooseneck jumper to the irresistibly sultry touch of the off-the-shoulder knitted top.Perhaps the most essential designs are the classic V-neck jumper and crew neck jumper, both of which are found in this selection with unrivalled tailoring and aesthetics. These classics are complemented by other styles such as the Perkins collar jumper and the turtleneck jumper. To achieve the effortless look so popular with the most stylish French women, simply pair a blazer with a turtleneck jumper, straight or denim trousers and loafers and let accessories do the rest.One of the biggest challenges that this garment often faces is warmth, therefore this collection features a variety of chunky knitted jumpers. Depending on the occasion and personal preference, one can play with the finishes and prints of the designs. A knitted jumper with openwork details can be the epitome of femininity, especially when combined with delicate and minimalist accessories, such as small earrings and fine rings to stylise the look.The striped knitted jumper is a safe bet for creating sophisticated looks with a chic touch. It also pairs well with denim, whether it's a pair of jeans or a denim skirt. As for footwear, this style can be worn with a wide range of options, from flat shoes such as trainers, ballet flats or loafers to boots and heeled sandals. The ribbed knit jumper is a perfect option to combine with a biker or bomber jacket to give a casual and nonchalant style.The most original styles are born from the interpretation of some of the most classic designs. Such is the case of the wool polo shirt, with its button-up shirt collar that adds an instant preppy touch. Another option —which is without a doubt one of the best examples of this aesthetic— is the knitted waistcoat. The advantage of this garment lies in its power to play with the layering elements of a look and instantly elevate an otherwise basic outfit. For its part, the cape jumper is a piece born from the hybridisation between the poncho and the oversized jumper, making it an alternative that is as comfortable as it is stylish.However, there are alternatives where coolness is vital. Contrary to popular belief, the jumper can also be worn when temperatures rise, simply choose alternatives in breathable, flowing fabrics. For example, the linen jumper fulfils this function perfectly, adding a sophisticated silhouette and unlimited comfort to any outfit.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"Warm and sophisticated jumpers","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":2172878,"name":"Dresses & Jumpsuits","nameEn":"Dresses & Jumpsuits","shortDescription":null,"description":"In this collection, <strong>dresses</strong>, which are key elements in every <strong>woman's</strong> wardrobe, are presented as a commitment to femininity, easy to wear and undoubtedly adaptable to suit many different occasions.

In the same way, linen party dresses fit perfectly into social events, especially if those are held during the daytime and enjoyed in the outdoors. Although of course, they can easily flow from day to night with corresponding complements. If by daytime the garment is accompanied by some sunglasses, wedge sandals, and a hat that adds a unique touch and at the same time protects from sun exposure, at night it could be combined with thin-heeled sandals, a handbag that stands out and your hair up in a bun. Among favourite summer linen dress options, long linen dress designs can show intense and subtle flair, depending on their silhouette and print.

The new collection from Massimo Dutti features a prominent and exclusive place for women's pink dresses, offering elegant as well as casual dress options that bring the possibility of building a versatile, timeless wardrobe that fits a multitude of events while embracing sophistication and style. It all depends on the situation and the intention. Based on the occasion's formality and the desired style, one may choose a specific shade of pink. Considering that this chromatic option fits perfectly in both summer and winter dresses, as well as short and long dresses, there are various design proposals for every season. For special events, cocktail dresses, graduation dresses, evening and party dresses in intense shades like fuchsia pink, which has been on-trend in recent seasons, make a statement and dazzle wherever they go, requiring only a few accessories to complement them flawlessly. Of course, for formal occasions where a delicate and naive aesthetic is desired, lighter shades like baby pink, pastel or dusty pink create an ethereal aura that is enhanced in lace, satin or chiffon dresses.

The new collection from Massimo Dutti features a prominent and exclusive place for women's pink dresses, offering elegant as well as casual dress options that bring the possibility of building a versatile, timeless wardrobe that fits a multitude of events while embracing sophistication and style. It all depends on the situation and the intention. Based on the occasion's formality and the desired style, one may choose a specific shade of pink. Considering that this chromatic option fits perfectly in both summer and winter dresses, as well as short and long dresses, there are various design proposals for every season. For special events, cocktail dresses, graduation dresses, evening and party dresses in intense shades like fuchsia pink, which has been on-trend in recent seasons, make a statement and dazzle wherever they go, requiring only a few accessories to complement them flawlessly. Of course, for formal occasions where a delicate and naive aesthetic is desired, lighter shades like baby pink, pastel or dusty pink create an ethereal aura that is enhanced in lace, satin or chiffon dresses.

Flattering and elegant silhouettes for a season full of style.","mainHeader":"Dresses for Women","longDescription":"In this collection, <strong>dresses</strong>, which are key elements in every <strong>woman's</strong> wardrobe, are presented as a commitment to femininity, easy to wear and undoubtedly adaptable to suit many different occasions. In this edit,&nbsp;<strong>Massimo Dutti's dresses</strong> are always marked by elegance, with flattering, flowing silhouettes and quality fabrics.<br><br>&nbsp;From the New York of the 80's, <strong>long dresses&nbsp;</strong>paired with trainers are still very much on-trend today, season after season, for their comfortable, urban-chic aesthetic. Southern American also returns in the form of <strong>dresses</strong> paired with short boots, a combination reminiscent of bohemian Californian styles. The key to the success of this ensemble is precisely the harmony created between the more forceful type of footwear in contrast with a delicate garment such as the&nbsp;<strong>flowing dress</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br>This collection features contrasting fabrics and textures: from the freshness and lightness of softer fabrics to the warmth and robustness of more full-bodied materials. For the former, we present the long linen and <strong>long silk dresses</strong> —both of which are considered to be the epitome of sophistication and go perfectly with <strong>sandals</strong> or<strong>&nbsp;ankle boots and practical handbags</strong> of any size. Meanwhile, the long <strong>poplin dress</strong> offers a totally versatile, day-to-day option suitable for any season. Moreover, it is easy to complement with other warmer or lighter garments, embracing the role of formality just as well when paired with more sober garments. Other models adaptable to a multitude of styles and looks are the knit dress and the&nbsp;<strong>cashmere dress</strong>.<br><br>Their soft textures make their quality evident at first glance, making it possible to create minimalist outfits in which less is more when it comes to a garment with an impeccable appearance. On the other hand, the more cosmopolitan designs include the <strong>long leather dress</strong> and the <strong>short dress</strong>, also<strong>&nbsp;in leather</strong>. In particular, the&nbsp;<strong>short black dress</strong> in this material has a particularly trendy character with a silhouette that does not disappoint, completely flattering and adaptable for strong and stylish looks.<br><br>&nbsp;For a more professional approach one can find a wide variety of available alternatives. For example, the <strong>long shirt dress</strong> is a simple yet comfortable choice <strong>suitable for office looks&nbsp;</strong>while the&nbsp;<strong>blazer dress</strong> is one of the best examples of elegance, and can be worn not only to business meetings but also to professional events and parties where you want to make a statement. &nbsp;<br><br>Meanwhile, the long cross over dress —whether long or short sleeved— undeniably flatters the silhouette with a relaxed sophistication appropriate for such occasions. For this edit, the most romantic pieces are presented in dresses from the 70s. The<strong>&nbsp;long printed</strong>, <strong>strapless and halter-neck dresses</strong> have a boho feel to them, giving the looks that nostalgic vintage touch. Recovering designs from other decades, we also find the <strong>pleated dress,</strong> a historical garment inspired by fashion and glamour icons, which today continues to create ultra-feminine looks.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"Elegant and casual dresses for women","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":1739723,"name":"Shirts & Blouses","nameEn":"Shirts & Blouses","shortDescription":null,"description":"From fluid designs to denim pieces, there's a style formula to suit every type of shirt.

Due to their timeless nature there is a wide selection of designs—both classic and contemporary—that keep this garment in full force. From classic models such as striped shirts to seasonal alternatives like the tie-dye shirt, the common denominator of these garments is the quality of the fabrics and the expertise of the brand's tailoring.Printed pieces draw the eye naturally—which is why it's essential to opt for the best designs. At the very pinnacle of style silk shirts are the perfect choice for any occasion, as their delicate sheen adds an elegant, ethereal feel to outfits that blends perfectly with formal events. Silk shirts are also perfect for more casual situations where they elevate everyday casual outfits and are sure to turn heads, adapting to any ocassion and adding sophistication at the same time.Among the most eye-catching options is the semi-transparent shirt, which is perfectly suited to festive or casual events. In addition, this garment offers the possibility of creating sensual outfits that follow the trend of revealing undergarments when worn over a bra, allowing it to show through or alternatively, it can be combined with a T-shirt or top for a more discreet look. In addition, when worn as an overshirt it can be left open to serve as an extra piece of an impeccable outfit, and still be the highlight of the outfit when buttoned up.A long shirt is also a versatile option that works well both buttoned up and unbuttoned. This piece can also be turned into a simple dress when the buttons are done up and can be worn with high boots and heels for cosmopolitan and trendy looks. Left unbuttoned, it doubles as an overshirt that adds dimension to looks and—thanks to its print—keeps them original and up to date.A collection of printed shirts would not be complete without some of our favourite designs that come back each season with renewed energy. The floral shirt adds a touch of instant freshness to outfits that don't need much more than a few fine accessories to enhance the romantic aura of this garment for a perfect look.

The brand's elegant top ticks all the boxes, from a long top with slits that lends grace and style to every movement to a crop top with straps to match a special occasion.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"From Basic Tops to Elegant Pieces for Women","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":2178918,"name":"Knitwear","nameEn":"Knitwear","shortDescription":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"key":"WOMEN_V_FAM_TOPS_PUNTO","numberOfProducts":null,"type":"22","viewCategoryId":0,"subcategories":[],"attachments":[{"id":"503951","name":"STORE_MODE","path":"STORE_MODE","type":"LABEL"},{"id":"554453","name":"FORCE_VIEW_6","path":"FORCE_VIEW_6","type":"LABEL"},{"id":"554951","name":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","path":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","type":"LABEL"}],"sequence":19,"oldIds":[],"categoryUrl":"women/tops-knit-n4328","categoryUrlTranslations":[],"seoCategory":{"name":"Knitwear","title":"Knitwear","metaDescription":"Knitwear","mainHeader":"Knitwear","longDescription":null,"keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":2185425,"name":"Crochet","nameEn":"Crochet","shortDescription":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"key":"WOMEN_V_FAM_TOPS_CROCHET","numberOfProducts":null,"type":"22","viewCategoryId":0,"subcategories":[],"attachments":[{"id":"503951","name":"STORE_MODE","path":"STORE_MODE","type":"STORE_MODE"},{"id":"554453","name":"FORCE_VIEW_6","path":"FORCE_VIEW_6","type":"LABEL"},{"id":"554951","name":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","path":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","type":"LABEL"}],"sequence":20,"oldIds":[],"categoryUrl":"women/tops-crochet-n4376","categoryUrlParam":"2185425","categoryUrlTranslations":[],"seoCategory":{"name":"Crochet","title":"Crochet","metaDescription":"Crochet","mainHeader":"Crochet","longDescription":null,"keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":2179418,"name":"Lino","nameEn":"Lino","shortDescription":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"key":"WOMEN_V_FAM_TOPS_LINO_WEB","numberOfProducts":null,"type":"22","viewCategoryId":0,"subcategories":[],"attachments":[{"id":"534951","name":"GAUDI","path":"GAUDI","type":"LABEL"},{"id":"554453","name":"FORCE_VIEW_6","path":"FORCE_VIEW_6","type":"LABEL"},{"id":"554951","name":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","path":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","type":"LABEL"}],"sequence":21,"oldIds":[],"categoryUrl":"women/tops-linen-n4327","categoryUrlParam":"2179418","categoryUrlTranslations":[],"seoCategory":{"name":"Lino","title":"Lino","metaDescription":"Lino","mainHeader":"Lino","longDescription":null,"keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":2179417,"name":"Satin","nameEn":"Satin","shortDescription":null,"description":null,"keywords":null,"key":"WOMEN_V_FAM_TOPS_SATEN_WEB","numberOfProducts":null,"type":"22","viewCategoryId":0,"subcategories":[],"attachments":[{"id":"503951","name":"STORE_MODE","path":"STORE_MODE","type":"LABEL"},{"id":"534951","name":"GAUDI","path":"GAUDI","type":"LABEL"},{"id":"554951","name":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","path":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","type":"LABEL"}],"sequence":22,"oldIds":[],"categoryUrl":"women/tops-satin-n4326","categoryUrlTranslations":[],"seoCategory":{"name":"Satin","title":"Satin","metaDescription":"Satin","mainHeader":"Satin","longDescription":null,"keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"","secondaryDescription":""}}],"attachments":[{"id":"503951","name":"STORE_MODE","path":"STORE_MODE","type":"STORE_MODE"},{"id":"554452","name":"FORCE_VIEW_STUDIO","path":"FORCE_VIEW_STUDIO","type":"LABEL"}],"sequence":23,"oldIds":[],"categoryUrl":"women/shirts-n1439","categoryUrlParam":"2028527","categoryUrlTranslations":[],"seoCategory":{"name":"Tops","title":"Women's Shirt","metaDescription":"Women's shirts made out of premium fabrics that come in a variety of different colours, perfect for styling to your own personal taste.","mainHeader":"Women's shirt","longDescription":"From fluid designs to denim pieces, there's a style formula to suit every type of shirt. The latest collection designs not only feature plain shirts, but also details such as pockets or mao collars, and fabrics such as suede or poplin. Shirts and T-shirts can be combined in both day-to-day and smart outfits. With a masculine pattern, from an off the shoulders style to knotted sleeves, the shirt is the most classic garment in any wardrobe. But if there is one piece that is reinvented in silhouettes and details, it is the blouse. Massimo Dutti's latest collection features a crochet blouse for women, with a handmade look of intertwined threads, perfect for overcoming any stylistic problem with a touch of originality.\n\n\nThe white shirt is the quintessential go-to garment. At the other end of the spectrum, the black shirt is also a classic piece that goes with everything. Paired with a skirt or trousers, the blue shirt is an essential garment that suits any woman, whether in the masculine aesthetic to create business looks or to create preppy ensembles.\n\nMeanwhile, the plain shirt is a basic wardrobe staple that can be integrated into a wide variety of outfits in countless ways. The latest collection also includes printed shirts, a masterful choice to liven up any look in the blink of an eye.\n\nWhen it comes to fabrics, poplin remains one of the most popular fabrics on the market. With a soft and defined look, suitable for both casual and business looks, a poplin shirt is the best companion for everyday wear. The striped poplin shirt goes great with both smart and casual looks, depending on the occasion.\n\nMassimo Dutti presents the silk shirt, a classic piece that has the potential to become the centrepiece of any woman's wardrobe and add a touch of sophistication. A linen shirt is a timeless and functional garment, perfect for a minimalist but stylish office look. Made from the same natural fabric —which stands out for its comfort and particular charm— a linen blouse can become the centrepiece of most women's outfits.\n\nWith its flowing, ethereal design, a sheer shirt gives character and poise to an outfit that is as simple as it is elegant. For more romantic looks, pair a flowing blouse with jeans and stilettos to create the perfect combination.\n\nA V-neck shirt has the power to refine a classic look and give it a touch of finesse and sophistication. Massimo Dutti's selection also includes a mao collar shirt, a garment capable of elevating any outfit, especially those with more basic pieces, such as a pair of straight-cut jeans. A shirt with pockets is an unmistakable icon of comfort and sophistication alike, making it an effortless outfit for day or night.\n\nLeather shirts never go unnoticed and have the ability to finish off any look with a touch of flair. Likewise, a suede shirt adapts to any style with its straight and simple cuts because its fabric is part of its charm. On the other hand, one of the most versatile pieces is the denim shirt, perfect for any time of the year. Over time, this garment has become a wardrobe essential unrivalled in terms of style.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"Simple and versatile women's shirts","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":2195421,"name":"100% Cashmere","nameEn":"100% Cashmere","shortDescription":null,"description":"Cashmere jumpers convey a feeling of warmth, exclusivity, and quality like no other material.

A variety of different colours and styles to match your own personal style.","mainHeader":"Trousers for Women","longDescription":"Women's trousers are an everyday wardrobe staple. With designs from the latest collection, it's easy to create looks that are both stylish and practical. The simplest and most infallible way of wearing trousers with trainers is to pair them with a blouse and jacket, counteracting the sporty, casual style of the shoes with more sophisticated garments to create a more understated look. At their most classic, women's chinos never go out of style, adapting to a smart look for an easy, comfortable and stylish look.\n\nGreen is more fashionable than ever. That's why Massimo Dutti's selection features green trousers, which have become a great starting point for creating practical everyday outfits that acquire elegance when paired with a pair of high heels. Bomber shorts in this collection feature high-quality fabric, making them flowing and elegant as well as flattering.\n\nThanks to the cut and fabric, the straight cut linen trousers are a timeless piece that will become a safe bet for any woman looking for maximum comfort and a natural look. Massimo Dutti's collection includes high-waist trousers that adapt to any style. With pure and minimalist lines, these trousers have a slightly higher waistline, which visually lengthens the silhouette and slims the waist area. Thanks to their cool fabrics and fluid silhouettes, the openwork trousers are as light as they are functional in casual outfits, but also in a more formal setting.\n\nEqually versatile and sophisticated, black trousers can be worn day or night. And while there is no doubt that black is the most classic colour, the fact is that grey trousers tailored to detail can also become any woman's best ally.\n\nSkinny trousers are a garment that never goes out of style and have proven to be adaptable to every outfit. On the other side of the spectrum, wide-leg trousers are comfortable with a touch of elegance. On the more comfortable side, jogging trousers offer a wide range of possibilities for comfort without compromising on style. Over the last few seasons, cropped trousers have become a staple for any time of the year. These trousers can be perfectly paired with sandals, loafers, ankle boots or even high heels for a trendy look.\n\nThis collection also features the culotte trousers, a hybrid that fuses the essence of Bermuda shorts and the width of palazzo trousers, the perfect alternative to the traditional office look. At its most comfortable, the fluid trousers recreate the optical effect of a midi skirt. Its dazzling aesthetic means that this piece doesn't need much to stand out and, and with a simple change of footwear, they can transition from day to night with little effort.\nNo longer restricted to special occasions, suit trousers are now increasingly being worn in more casual settings. A simpler option is to wear them with classic plain shirts or a timeless knitted top.\n\nThe pegged trouser is an infallible choice that has left its place as a formal garment to dynamite the everyday style codes by combining it with more casual pieces. As leaders of casual style that can also be as elegant as tailored trousers, knitted trousers are one of the most versatile and comfortable garments. The Chino trousers —capable of elevating any look in a matter of seconds— are the epitome of elegance and comfort.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"Stylish and comfortable trousers for women","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":1739556,"name":"Formal Wear","nameEn":"Formal Wear","shortDescription":null,"description":"Massimo Dutti's women's formal trousers are perfect for building smart looks and will more than live up to a variety of settings. The selection ranges from the classic pleated trousers that never go out of fashion thanks to their universal charm, to impeccable versions of the flared dress trousers with a retro vibe, as well as the straight trousers with sleek and simple lines that are a must-have in any woman's wardrobe. Special mention should be made of the trousers with slits, which integrate a subtle cut at the bottom of the trousers that contributes to slimming down the figure while adding a graceful touch of movement that is even more noticeable in fluid fabrics—all of which has earned it a place among the classic silhouettes.\n\n\nWhen it comes to formal dress codes, it's essential to invest in fabrics of the highest quality. This is where Massimo Dutti's collection of women's dress trousers comes in, providing that premium edge to your styling. At the heart of every formal wardrobe, the collection's dark wool trousers testify to the brand's penchant for quality fabrics and timeless cuts and designs. However, women's suit trousers can adopt a wide range of materials and colours that go beyond those commonly associated with this garment. Proof of this is the satin trousers in fluid fabric, a sumptuous style that speaks the language of the most refined events. To get the most out of them, pair them with a matching blazer over a strapless top or a smart shirt and finish the look with a pair of sophisticated high-heeled sandals.\n\nFor professional wear, tailored women's office trousers from this collection ensure a seamless look, finding their best allies in blazers and formal shoes. Reflecting both professionalism and good taste, textured trousers, including the traditional herringbone weave, are an excellent idea for business meetings and work environments. The selection also features women's belted trousers, which combine stretch with a high-waist cut for a result that is as comfortable as it is flattering.\n\nWhile women's black trousers are still relevant, as this selection shows, the colour palette also includes more vibrant options, including orange, fuchsia and bright shades of blue. The idea that elegant women's trousers should be limited to neutral colours is long gone. Classic black or beige models now coexist in perfect harmony with bolder alternatives tailored to suit all scenarios and preferences.","keywords":null,"key":"WOMEN_V_FAM_TROUSERS_FORMAL","numberOfProducts":null,"type":"22","viewCategoryId":0,"subcategories":[],"attachments":[{"id":"503951","name":"STORE_MODE","path":"STORE_MODE","type":"STORE_MODE"},{"id":"554453","name":"FORCE_VIEW_6","path":"FORCE_VIEW_6","type":"LABEL"},{"id":"554951","name":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","path":"SHOW_CATEGORY_PRODUCTS","type":"LABEL"}],"sequence":40,"oldIds":[],"categoryUrl":"women/trousers/formal-n1484","categoryUrlParam":"1739556","categoryUrlTranslations":[],"seoCategory":{"name":"Formal Wear","title":"Women's Dress Trousers","metaDescription":"Formal Wear","mainHeader":"Formal Trousers","longDescription":"Massimo Dutti's women's formal trousers are perfect for building smart looks and will more than live up to a variety of settings.

With designs from the latest collection, it's easy to create looks that are both stylish and practical. The simplest and most infallible way of wearing trousers with trainers is to pair them with a blouse and jacket, counteracting the sporty, casual style of the shoes with more sophisticated garments to create a more understated look. At their most classic, women's chinos never go out of style, adapting to a smart look for an easy, comfortable and stylish look.Green is more fashionable than ever. That's why Massimo Dutti's selection features green trousers, which have become a great starting point for creating practical everyday outfits that acquire elegance when paired with a pair of high heels. Bomber shorts in this collection feature high-quality fabric, making them flowing and elegant as well as flattering.Thanks to the cut and fabric, the straight cut linen trousers are a timeless piece that will become a safe bet for any woman looking for maximum comfort and a natural look. Massimo Dutti's collection includes high-waist trousers that adapt to any style. With pure and minimalist lines, these trousers have a slightly higher waistline, which visually lengthens the silhouette and slims the waist area. Thanks to their cool fabrics and fluid silhouettes, the openwork trousers are as light as they are functional in casual outfits, but also in a more formal setting.Equally versatile and sophisticated, black trousers can be worn day or night. And while there is no doubt that black is the most classic colour, the fact is that grey trousers tailored to detail can also become any woman's best ally.Skinny trousers are a garment that never goes out of style and have proven to be adaptable to every outfit. On the other side of the spectrum, wide-leg trousers are comfortable with a touch of elegance. On the more comfortable side, jogging trousers offer a wide range of possibilities for comfort without compromising on style. Over the last few seasons, cropped trousers have become a staple for any time of the year. These trousers can be perfectly paired with sandals, loafers, ankle boots or even high heels for a trendy look.This collection also features the culotte trousers, a hybrid that fuses the essence of Bermuda shorts and the width of palazzo trousers, the perfect alternative to the traditional office look. At its most comfortable, the fluid trousers recreate the optical effect of a midi skirt. Its dazzling aesthetic means that this piece doesn't need much to stand out and, and with a simple change of footwear, they can transition from day to night with little effort.No longer restricted to special occasions, suit trousers are now increasingly being worn in more casual settings. A simpler option is to wear them with classic plain shirts or a timeless knitted top.The pegged trouser is an infallible choice that has left its place as a formal garment to dynamite the everyday style codes by combining it with more casual pieces. As leaders of casual style that can also be as elegant as tailored trousers, knitted trousers are one of the most versatile and comfortable garments. The Chino trousers —capable of elevating any look in a matter of seconds— are the epitome of elegance and comfort.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"Stylish and comfortable trousers for women","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":1830019,"name":"Jeans","nameEn":"Jeans","shortDescription":null,"description":"Massimo Dutti women's jeans are a guarantee of comfort even on the most demanding of days. Moreover, they offer the most flattering versions of each type of cut to reflect the natural elegance of the brand's aesthetic codes. From straight-cut and slim jeans with a timeless vibe, to flared and bootcut jeans with a subtle retro touch, to wide-leg jeans in culotte style, the selection offers a wide range of silhouettes to suit all preferences. The popular high-waisted skinny jeans with their shaping effect, take on both straight and flare-fit shapes, reinforcing their presence in the collection and broadening their appeal.\n\nFor instance, there is the ankle-high slit jeans and crop jeans, featuring an ankle style that strategically halts at the calf level, which has a slimming effect and creates the illusion of longer legs. While both of these details initially give off a slightly more casual vibe than conventional skinny jeans, they work just as well with a T-shirt and trainers as they do with a smart blazer and heels of all sorts—making them an everyday staple from Monday to Sunday.\n\nOur selection includes every conceivable style for this garment, bringing refinement to any of its versions, whether it's a baggy pair of jeans, skinny jeans or timeless denim shorts. Moreover, the denim Bermuda shorts is a concept that patiently awaits the arrival of the warmer months to steal the spotlight. Exuding femininity thanks to its high rise and the attention it draws from one of the most sensual parts of the body, this piece allows for multiple combinations depending on what the occasion calls for.\n\nIn terms of the way women's jeans look on the body, the height of the waist is just as important as the shape of the leg. For this reason, Massimo Dutti also pays special attention when it comes to this factor, providing an optimal fit for both women who love high-waisted jeans and those who prefer medium-waisted jeans. And what should be taken into account when choosing one style or the other for a particular look? The main thing is that high-waisted jeans accentuate the length of the legs, while low-rise jeans sit a little lower, on more neutral ground. However, Massimo Dutti's cropped styles are proof that mid-rise jeans can also create a very slim leg.\n\nFeaturing a range of colours, this collection's women's jeans come in a variety of timeless shades. From classic blue jeans to white jeans for sunny days, from versatile grey jeans to black jeans for an eye-catching all-black look.","keywords":null,"key":"WOMEN_V_FAM_JEANS","numberOfProducts":null,"type":"22","viewCategoryId":675012,"subcategories":[{"id":675012,"name":"View all","nameEn":"View all","shortDescription":null,"description":"Massimo Dutti women's jeans are a guarantee of comfort even on the most demanding of days.

While both of these details initially give off a slightly more casual vibe than conventional skinny jeans, they work just as well with a T-shirt and trainers as they do with a smart blazer and heels of all sorts—making them an everyday staple from Monday to Sunday.\n\nOur selection includes every conceivable style for this garment, bringing refinement to any of its versions, whether it's a baggy pair of jeans, skinny jeans or timeless denim shorts. Moreover, the denim Bermuda shorts is a concept that patiently awaits the arrival of the warmer months to steal the spotlight. Exuding femininity thanks to its high rise and the attention it draws from one of the most sensual parts of the body, this piece allows for multiple combinations depending on what the occasion calls for.\n\nIn terms of the way women's jeans look on the body, the height of the waist is just as important as the shape of the leg. For this reason, Massimo Dutti also pays special attention when it comes to this factor, providing an optimal fit for both women who love high-waisted jeans and those who prefer medium-waisted jeans. And what should be taken into account when choosing one style or the other for a particular look? The main thing is that high-waisted jeans accentuate the length of the legs, while low-rise jeans sit a little lower, on more neutral ground. However, Massimo Dutti's cropped styles are proof that mid-rise jeans can also create a very slim leg.\n\nFeaturing a range of colours, this collection's women's jeans come in a variety of timeless shades.

Crafted from exclusive materials, they are easy to mix and match.","mainHeader":"Women's Jeans","longDescription":"Massimo Dutti women's jeans are a guarantee of comfort even on the most demanding of days. Moreover, they offer the most flattering versions of each type of cut to reflect the natural elegance of the brand's aesthetic codes. From straight-cut and slim jeans with a timeless vibe, to flared and bootcut jeans with a subtle retro touch, to wide-leg jeans in culotte style, the selection offers a wide range of silhouettes to suit all preferences. The popular high-waisted skinny jeans with their shaping effect, take on both straight and flare-fit shapes, reinforcing their presence in the collection and broadening their appeal.\n\nFor instance, there is the ankle-high slit jeans and crop jeans, featuring an ankle style that strategically halts at the calf level, which has a slimming effect and creates the illusion of longer legs. While both of these details initially give off a slightly more casual vibe than conventional skinny jeans, they work just as well with a T-shirt and trainers as they do with a smart blazer and heels of all sorts—making them an everyday staple from Monday to Sunday.\n\nOur selection includes every conceivable style for this garment, bringing refinement to any of its versions, whether it's a baggy pair of jeans, skinny jeans or timeless denim shorts. Moreover, the denim Bermuda shorts is a concept that patiently awaits the arrival of the warmer months to steal the spotlight. Exuding femininity thanks to its high rise and the attention it draws from one of the most sensual parts of the body, this piece allows for multiple combinations depending on what the occasion calls for.\n\nIn terms of the way women's jeans look on the body, the height of the waist is just as important as the shape of the leg. For this reason, Massimo Dutti also pays special attention when it comes to this factor, providing an optimal fit for both women who love high-waisted jeans and those who prefer medium-waisted jeans. And what should be taken into account when choosing one style or the other for a particular look? The main thing is that high-waisted jeans accentuate the length of the legs, while low-rise jeans sit a little lower, on more neutral ground. However, Massimo Dutti's cropped styles are proof that mid-rise jeans can also create a very slim leg.\n\nFeaturing a range of colours, this collection's women's jeans come in a variety of timeless shades. From classic blue jeans to white jeans for sunny days, from versatile grey jeans to black jeans for an eye-catching all-black look.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"Jeans for Women","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":1835010,"name":"Skirts","nameEn":"Skirts","shortDescription":null,"description":"Skirts are an essential piece that can be worn regardless of the occasion or time of year. Depending on the accessories and the type of footwear they are paired with, they can adapt to any style and dress code. Short skirts offer the possibility of creating an infinite number of outfits when paired with ankle boots that elevate the look in a matter of seconds; a long skirt is also ideal for creating original looks, providing the perfect combination for a wedding look when paired with a blouse and jeweled heels. A black skirt, on the other hand, is the ultimate embodiment of timelessness in a woman's wardrobe: one of the most versatile pieces that adapts to all styles and can be worn to create a wide variety of outfits.\n\nFrom miniskirts to long denim skirts, Massimo Dutti offers flattering silhouettes in high-quality fabrics that will become the best allies of any woman who appreciates sophistication and comfort in equal measure. Pleated skirts, characterised by their defined pleats, are very versatile and can be combined in many different ways. On a more casual note, a pair of trainers with a pleated skirt can add a twist to an outfit perfect for everyday wear. Wearing a pleated skirt with ankle boots is also a brilliant way to create sophisticated everyday outfits. For its part, the pleated skirt has sufficient flair to elevate the look to aesthetic levels with a certain old-school feel and a refined touch.\n\nMassimo Dutti also includes the sarong skirt, which is as original as it is flattering for creating an infinite number of looks. From the most classic version to designs that reinvent this option such as the printed or knotted sarong skirt, they can be paired with all types of footwear and, at the same time, stylise and refine the outfit. In its most chic version, the ruffled mini skirt makes the waist perfectly defined, while volume at the hem helps create a curvaceous silhouette. In addition, wearing a mini skirt with tights and ankle boots is one of the best ideas to add a touch of elegance and flair to your outfit. A leather midi skirt, paired with slim heels and an elegant blouse, creates the perfect combo for when the occasion calls for a more tailored ensemble.\n\nDenim skirts are magnetic because of their versatility: they are timeless, can be worn all year round and go with absolutely anything in your wardrobe. A long denim skirt and a white shirt make up one of the most classic —and infallible— pairings of the season. With a hippie aesthetic and a bohemian spirit, a tie dye skirt has the potential to become the absolute star of the look. For more casual dates, a long satin skirt in this print is the ideal choice.

A perfect addition to your closet which can be styled for any occasion and time of the year.","mainHeader":"Skirts for women","longDescription":"Skirts are an essential piece that can be worn regardless of the occasion or time of year. Depending on the accessories and the type of footwear they are paired with, they can adapt to any style and dress code. Short skirts offer the possibility of creating an infinite number of outfits when paired with ankle boots that elevate the look in a matter of seconds; a long skirt is also ideal for creating original looks, providing the perfect combination for a wedding look when paired with a blouse and jeweled heels. A black skirt, on the other hand, is the ultimate embodiment of timelessness in a woman's wardrobe: one of the most versatile pieces that adapts to all styles and can be worn to create a wide variety of outfits.\n\nFrom miniskirts to long denim skirts, Massimo Dutti offers flattering silhouettes in high-quality fabrics that will become the best allies of any woman who appreciates sophistication and comfort in equal measure. Pleated skirts, characterised by their defined pleats, are very versatile and can be combined in many different ways. On a more casual note, a pair of trainers with a pleated skirt can add a twist to an outfit perfect for everyday wear. Wearing a pleated skirt with ankle boots is also a brilliant way to create sophisticated everyday outfits. For its part, the pleated skirt has sufficient flair to elevate the look to aesthetic levels with a certain old-school feel and a refined touch.\n\nMassimo Dutti also includes the sarong skirt, which is as original as it is flattering for creating an infinite number of looks. From the most classic version to designs that reinvent this option such as the printed or knotted sarong skirt, they can be paired with all types of footwear and, at the same time, stylise and refine the outfit. In its most chic version, the ruffled mini skirt makes the waist perfectly defined, while volume at the hem helps create a curvaceous silhouette. In addition, wearing a mini skirt with tights and ankle boots is one of the best ideas to add a touch of elegance and flair to your outfit. A leather midi skirt, paired with slim heels and an elegant blouse, creates the perfect combo for when the occasion calls for a more tailored ensemble.\n\nDenim skirts are magnetic because of their versatility: they are timeless, can be worn all year round and go with absolutely anything in your wardrobe. A long denim skirt and a white shirt make up one of the most classic —and infallible— pairings of the season. With a hippie aesthetic and a bohemian spirit, a tie dye skirt has the potential to become the absolute star of the look. For more casual dates, a long satin skirt in this print is the ideal choice. Additionally, a more romantic version of this piece is the floral printed skirt, a versatile garment for both daytime and evening looks.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"Skirts that are stylish and versatile","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":2165377,"name":"Shoes","nameEn":"Shoes","shortDescription":null,"description":"Massimo Dutti's selection of elegant women's shoes is a reliable guarantee of class for every occasion, whether it's women's flat ankle boots in tune with everyday looks or dressy heeled sandals for dining out at a fancy restaurant.

The influence of crochet bags has made the aesthetics of this traditional technique transcend to every season of the year, giving rise to designs that emulate its finish, such as braided leather bags. Going from aesthetics to functionality, quilted bags give a futuristic look while keeping all your belongings safe thanks to their shock-absorbing structure.The tote bag, one of the most popular large bags of the last few seasons, comes in neutral tones and innovative designs that bring this new classic up to date. With a less minimalist structure, the satchel bag offers a more casual and slightly rustic style while the shopper bag is a favourite for executive looks, including multiple compartments and accessories inside, making it the perfect alternative to office briefcases and work backpacks.Within the selection of medium-sized bags, shoulder bags are an essential piece in any woman's collection of accessories.

Halfway between a satchel bag and a shoulder bag, the bucket bag recaptures the romantic, bohemian aesthetic of the 70s and is usually presented with an adjustable drawstring closure and details.Thanks to new technologies, nowadays everything fits on a smartphone. This is why small bags are becoming increasingly popular. With room for a mobile phone and little else, the pochette bag, handbag or clutch bag is a stylish yet practical accessory.

For this reason, Massimo Dutti offers a selection of accessories made with attention to detail and designed for modern women to be able to accompany them in various situations. At the height of functionality are women’s handbags. Not only are they enormously useful pieces to safely keep and transport personal belongings, but they also have incredible potential to complete outfits and instantly elevate them. In a similar way, women's wallets fulfill a dual purpose in which practicality and style both have a place. Massimo Dutti's women's belts are items that hold a certain level of functionality in addition to having an extremely meticulous and elegant appearance that perfectly complements looks from professional and formal to more casual ones. In the same sense, other accessories such as sunglasses, watches and women's hats are of similar character: they are all pieces designed to fulfill needs such as sun protection or checking the time, but at the same time can ooze style and influence different outfits. Meanwhile, when the temperatures drop, Massimo Dutti's women's scarves, gloves, and hats are unbeatable when an extra dose of warmth is required with a subtly distinctive touch that creates a sophisticated quality winter look. On the purely aesthetic side, it is women's jewellery that stands out, of course. Among these accessories, women's earrings hold a particular characteristic not only affecting the clothes they are worn with but also allowing them to influence the face due to their proximity to this area.

However, within the same breath of acting as a useful item, it can perfectly go hand in hand with having an aesthetic appearance. With this thought in mind, the selection was born aiming to bring both aspects together and offer fashionable belts with timeless and quality designs that respond to the diverse needs of today's women. An item's functionality and good looks are incomplete if they do not additionally adhere to exceptional quality.

In addition, leather belts can always add sophistication to different kinds of looks, whether casual or formal.

To obtain a completely minimalist look, options with thin and delicate buckles will make the obviously ideal choice. Beyond that, if the chosen belt design has a buckle that goes well with the accessories and jewellery added later, it would be the styling that gains coherence and offer a completely seamless appearance. For example, if you are going to create an outfit using a silver necklace, rings, earrings, and bracelets, and combine it with a belt that has a buckle with the same tone, you will get an unbeatable aesthetic, much like in gold if that is the case. To subtract the elements of jewellery while still achieving the same impact can be made all the difference by using chain belts. On the other hand, the width of a belt should also be considered an important aspect. For the most special occasions where formal outfits are used, it is best to opt for thin belts.

Massimo Dutti offers a wide range that adapts to any style, from retro sunglasses to current geometric shapes. When choosing the best protection, it is interesting to pay attention to the colour as well. Brown oval sunglasses with a tortoiseshell print will help prevent the passage of blue light but will also serve as a timeless element. When it comes to optimal protection from the sun's rays, polarized sunglasses are the perfect choice that will not sacrifice elegance in any case. In addition to protecting the eyes, they reduce reflections and improve visual clarity, and are especially recommended for driving or for any outdoor event. Sophistication and glamour are the main elements that form the cat eye sunglasses. This type of sunglasses pairs well as a dazzling factor both with an elegant outfit and a more casual style. Their pointed frames highlight feminine features and provide a touch of distinction. In terms of elegant women’s sunglasses, this style option will never run short within the Massimo Dutti selections which offer an infinity of high-quality finishes going from shiny acetate to a matte metallic finish. In contrast to the cat shape, square sunglasses evoke a sense of good taste and authority. Their rectilinear and angular design creates a determined appearance, which makes them an impeccable complement for those looking to project a confident image. This style of large sunglasses looks great on more rounded face shapes, as its straight lines can help balance the softness of the features. On the other hand, aviator-style sunglasses are perfect for heart-shaped faces or round faces, as they stylize and balance the face's proportions. One must not forget that despite being a basic element that can accompany multiple looks, sunglasses should not be left as a neutral component. Massimo Dutti's sunglasses collection contains a bold selection of colourful glasses that includes pastel shades, intense reds, and vibrant greens. On the opposite side, transparent plastic frames are a rising trend in fashionable sunglasses. This minimalist style allows the lens to be the main protagonist, creating a light effect thanks to the absence of a heavy structure.

The latest collection designs not only feature plain shirts, but also details such as pockets or mao collars, and fabrics such as suede or poplin. Shirts and T-shirts can be combined in both day-to-day and smart outfits. With a masculine pattern, from an off the shoulders style to knotted sleeves, the shirt is the most classic garment in any wardrobe. But if there is one piece that is reinvented in silhouettes and details, it is the blouse. Massimo Dutti's latest collection features a crochet blouse for women, perfect for overcoming any stylistic problem with a touch of originality.The white shirt is the quintessential go-to garment. At the other end of the spectrum, the black shirt is also a classic piece that goes with everything. Paired with a skirt or trousers, the blue shirt is an essential garment that suits any woman, whether in the masculine aesthetic to create business looks or to create preppy ensembles.Meanwhile, the plain shirt is a basic wardrobe staple that can be integrated into a wide variety of outfits in countless ways. The latest collection also includes printed shirts, a masterful choice to liven up any look in the blink of an eye.When it comes to fabrics, poplin remains one of the most popular fabrics on the market. With a soft and defined look, suitable for both casual and business looks, a poplin shirt is the best companion for everyday wear. The striped poplin shirt goes great with both smart and casual looks, depending on the occasion.Massimo Dutti presents the silk shirt, a classic piece that has the potential to become the centrepiece of any woman's wardrobe and add a touch of sophistication. A linen shirt is a timeless and functional garment, perfect for a minimalist but stylish office look. Made from the same natural fabric —which stands out for its comfort and particular charm— a linen blouse can become the centrepiece of most women's outfits.With its flowing, ethereal design, a sheer shirt gives character and poise to an outfit that is as simple as it is elegant. For more romantic looks, pair a flowing blouse with jeans and stilettos to create the perfect combination.A V-neck shirt has the power to refine a classic look and give it a touch of finesse and sophistication. Massimo Dutti's selection also includes a mao collar shirt, a garment capable of elevating any outfit, especially those with more basic pieces, such as a pair of straight-cut jeans. A shirt with pockets is an unmistakable icon of comfort and sophistication alike, making it an effortless outfit for day or night.Leather shirts never go unnoticed and have the ability to finish off any look with a touch of flair. Likewise, a suede shirt adapts to any style with its straight and simple cuts because its fabric is part of its charm.

Somewhere between the irreverent touch of a leather jacket and the protection provided by a coat, the aviator style jacket is an original garment with a timeless design that radiates strength anywhere it goes.Another reliable option for everyday wear is the men's anorak. The pattern of this jacket allows different combinations to obtain fully technical, thermo-sealed and hooded designs, reliable whenever the temperatures drop or the weather is uncertain. Due to its distinctly casual feel, both everyday outfits and looks for leisure and relaxation are a given. Among the most stylish options, the white and the beige anorak for men open the door to new pairing options and —thanks to their neutral tones, which are so in vogue season after season— they are elevated and updated designs.One of the most versatile alternatives is the pea-jacket. Its cross-buttoned design gives this modestly sourced garment a subtly elevated yet understated and unpretentious look, making it an ideal complement to cosmopolitan casual and smart casual looks.Lastly, when it comes to keeping a smart look in cold weather, the men's long coat is the winning choice. With its sleek design, it is the epitome of sophistication and provides almost all-round protection thanks to its length, which makes it the ideal complement to casual and smart casual cosmopolitan looks.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":2014019,"name":"Leather Jackets","nameEn":"Leather Jackets","shortDescription":"Leather jackets","description":"Massimo Dutti renders homage to men's leather jackets by presenting a selection of leather jackets that are all about quality, durability and a superb touch of style.\n\nMen's leather jackets date back to the early 20th century, although the different styles that exist today have many different origins and became popular decades later.

Massimo Dutti's men's jumpers are a versatile garment which can be the centrepiece of any look. This men's jumper collection embodies high quality, as it values the quality of the materials used in each garment. Fabrics such as cotton, wool and cashmere are characterised by their timelessness and are ideal to build the basis of any man's wardrobe. The men's roll neck jumper is the epitome of elegance; adding this garment to your wardrobe adds a touch of sophistication to any ensemble you pair it with. Wear it as part of a formal outfit by layering it underneath a blazer. This outfit is perfect for adding a different twist to the classic work look of a shirt and jacket, and it is also the best ally against cold weather. Choosing a black men's jumper as the base, this same combination can be turned into a truly unique evening look. When it comes to everyday wear, it is important to choose functional garments for easier decision making. A knitted jumper can be a good wardrobe staple to wear with any trousers, from jeans to chinos. Another great choice is a white jumper, given that it complements any classic colour in a man's wardrobe. It can even be used to tone down the intensity of patterned trousers or to create on-trend total looks in lighter shades. Another practical idea for wearing a knitted jumper to work is to combine a jumper with a shirt. Taking advantage of the elegant details of the classic shirt is a smart choice to elevate the style of this look. Choosing a men's zip-up jumper adds a genuine touch to the look, and those with a mock neck are a safe bet for a slightly cooler look. Another more classic alternative is the V-neck jumper, which is the optimal choice for highlighting the collar of a shirt. Furthermore, this type of collar creates a slimming effect thanks to the continuity of the design towards the chest. Fabric selection is vital for choosing the right jumper for you. For example, a men's wool jumper is an excellent choice to wear as a single garment and avoid layering. Wool is a robust fabric with a great ability to protect against cold weather. However, if softness is your main requirement, cashmere is the winning choice, a fabric delicate to the touch that will stand the test of time —the ideal investment for creating a good wardrobe. Apart from being worn during the colder months, a thin jumper can be the ideal companion in milder climates. And even in the warmer months, a thin jumper could be a perfect choice for evenings by the sea.","keywords":null,"key":"MEN_V_FAM_JUMPERS","numberOfProducts":null,"type":"22","viewCategoryId":1736768,"subcategories":[{"id":1736768,"name":"View all","nameEn":"View all","shortDescription":null,"description":"Men's jumpers make all the difference in a man's wardrobe when it comes to the quality of the fabric they are made from.

Perfect for any occasion to provide extra warmth in the colder seasons.","mainHeader":"Jumpers and Cardigans for Men","longDescription":"Men's jumpers make all the difference in a man's wardrobe when it comes to the quality of the fabric they are made from. Massimo Dutti's men's jumpers are a versatile garment which can be the centrepiece of any look. This men's jumper collection embodies high quality, as it values the quality of the materials used in each garment. Fabrics such as cotton, wool and cashmere are characterised by their timelessness and are ideal to build the basis of any man's wardrobe. The men's roll neck jumper is the epitome of elegance; adding this garment to your wardrobe adds a touch of sophistication to any ensemble you pair it with. Wear it as part of a formal outfit by layering it underneath a blazer. This outfit is perfect for adding a different twist to the classic work look of a shirt and jacket, and it is also the best ally against cold weather. Choosing a black men's jumper as the base, this same combination can be turned into a truly unique evening look. When it comes to everyday wear, it is important to choose functional garments for easier decision making. A knitted jumper can be a good wardrobe staple to wear with any trousers, from jeans to chinos. Another great choice is a white jumper, given that it complements any classic colour in a man's wardrobe. It can even be used to tone down the intensity of patterned trousers or to create on-trend total looks in lighter shades. Another practical idea for wearing a knitted jumper to work is to combine a jumper with a shirt. Taking advantage of the elegant details of the classic shirt is a smart choice to elevate the style of this look. Choosing a men's zip-up jumper adds a genuine touch to the look, and those with a mock neck are a safe bet for a slightly cooler look. Another more classic alternative is the V-neck jumper, which is the optimal choice for highlighting the collar of a shirt. Furthermore, this type of collar creates a slimming effect thanks to the continuity of the design towards the chest. Fabric selection is vital for choosing the right jumper for you. For example, a men's wool jumper is an excellent choice to wear as a single garment and avoid layering. Wool is a robust fabric with a great ability to protect against cold weather. However, if softness is your main requirement, cashmere is the winning choice, a fabric delicate to the touch that will stand the test of time —the ideal investment for creating a good wardrobe. Apart from being worn during the colder months, a thin jumper can be the ideal companion in milder climates. And even in the warmer months, a thin jumper could be a perfect choice for evenings by the sea.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":1529555,"name":"Cardigans","nameEn":"Cardigans","shortDescription":null,"description":"The knit is an infallible fabric that is a must-have in any fashion repertoire, and a men's cardigan is a garment not to be missed from any man's fundamental wardrobe.

To pursue an even more casual and sporty look, the hooded cardigan is configured as an ideal cardigan option for the modern and stylish man.

Elegance and class are guaranteed in all three, the only difference between them being the different silhouettes of each. The most fitted design is found in slim-fit trousers, which can be worn paired with slim-fit blazers. Meanwhile, regular fit trousers adopt a straight shape and stand a little further away from the body for a more classic touch, making them the ideal companion for a slightly more generous blazer. Somewhere in between are tapered-fit trousers, which taper slightly from the knee. By integrating features of the two previous styles, the latter cut can work as well with a slim blazer as with a more casual, relaxed jacket.And while the cuts offer variety to suit all preferences, trouser styles certainly do as well. The collection includes premium denim jeans for everyday wear, as well as versatile 5-pocket trousers. Thanks to their timeless washes and colours, they can effortlessly stand in for dress trousers for a twist on the typical office look. The selection also features chino trousers, which are suitable for all kinds of outfits and work for a wide variety of occasions. And for smart engagements that call for a shirt and blazer, and perhaps a tie, Massimo Dutti offers dress trousers in a range of classic, timeless colours, where comfort and style lie in their impeccable cut and craftsmanship from the finest quality fabrics.At the more casual end of the spectrum are styles such as cargo trousers, which feature mid-thigh flap pockets inspired by military clothing. However, in Massimo Dutti's models you can always expect that elegant touch befitting of a well-dressed man. The casual trousers section also includes Bermuda shorts, a must-have style for the warmer months that can be worn with a T-shirt and trainers or with a shirt and boat shoes for a leisurewear look that stands out from the crowd. And when the temperature rises, linen trousers for men are the perfect choice. Thanks to their lightweight fabric, they provide coolness and comfort, allowing for exceptional outfits when paired with the right items, such as a blazer in the same fabric, a light shirt and sophisticated espadrilles.Available in every possible cut and style —from the classic straight-cut jeans that are a wardrobe staple to the most refined suit trousers, from the versatile chinos to the stylish 5-pocket trousers— the Massimo Dutti collection is based on variety and the best materials to guarantee a flattering, comfortable and durable garment.","keywords":null,"key":"MEN_V_FAM_TROUSERS","numberOfProducts":null,"type":"22","viewCategoryId":911182,"subcategories":[{"id":911182,"name":"View all","nameEn":"View all","shortDescription":null,"description":"Massimo Dutti men's trousers embrace the three most stylish and popular contemporary cuts: slim, regular and tapered.

Elegance and class are guaranteed in all three, the only difference between them being the different silhouettes of each. The most fitted design is found in slim-fit trousers, which can be worn paired with slim-fit blazers. Meanwhile, regular fit trousers adopt a straight shape and stand a little further away from the body for a more classic touch, making them the ideal companion for a slightly more generous blazer. Somewhere in between are tapered-fit trousers, which taper slightly from the knee. By integrating features of the two previous styles, the latter cut can work as well with a slim blazer as with a more casual, relaxed jacket.\n\nAnd while the cuts offer variety to suit all preferences, trouser styles certainly do as well. The collection includes premium denim jeans for everyday wear, as well as versatile 5-pocket trousers. Thanks to their timeless washes and colours, they can effortlessly stand in for dress trousers for a twist on the typical office look.

Elegance and class are guaranteed in all three, the only difference between them being the different silhouettes of each. The most fitted design is found in slim-fit trousers, which can be worn paired with slim-fit blazers. Meanwhile, regular fit trousers adopt a straight shape and stand a little further away from the body for a more classic touch, making them the ideal companion for a slightly more generous blazer. Somewhere in between are tapered-fit trousers, which taper slightly from the knee. By integrating features of the two previous styles, the latter cut can work as well with a slim blazer as with a more casual, relaxed jacket.And while the cuts offer variety to suit all preferences, trouser styles certainly do as well. The collection includes premium denim jeans for everyday wear, as well as versatile 5-pocket trousers. Thanks to their timeless washes and colours, they can effortlessly stand in for dress trousers for a twist on the typical office look. The selection also features chino trousers, which are suitable for all kinds of outfits and work for a wide variety of occasions. And for smart engagements that call for a shirt and blazer, and perhaps a tie, Massimo Dutti offers dress trousers in a range of classic, timeless colours, where comfort and style lie in their impeccable cut and craftsmanship from the finest quality fabrics.At the more casual end of the spectrum are styles such as cargo trousers, which feature mid-thigh flap pockets inspired by military clothing. However, in Massimo Dutti's models you can always expect that elegant touch befitting of a well-dressed man. The casual trousers section also includes Bermuda shorts, a must-have style for the warmer months that can be worn with a T-shirt and trainers or with a shirt and boat shoes for a leisurewear look that stands out from the crowd. And when the temperature rises, linen trousers for men are the perfect choice. Thanks to their lightweight fabric, they provide coolness and comfort, allowing for exceptional outfits when paired with the right items, such as a blazer in the same fabric, a light shirt and sophisticated espadrilles.Available in every possible cut and style —from the classic straight-cut jeans that are a wardrobe staple to the most refined suit trousers, from the versatile chinos to the stylish 5-pocket trousers— the Massimo Dutti collection is based on variety and the best materials to guarantee a flattering, comfortable and durable garment.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":2163890,"name":"Jeans","nameEn":"Jeans","shortDescription":null,"description":"When it comes to jeans, it's important to consider the fit that best suits your body type and preference. From straight jeans to slim fit jeans, this Massimo Dutti's denim collection adapts to a variety of men's silhouettes. Denim is at the heart of most men's wardrobe and, for this reason, it is a wardrobe staple.\n\nTapered jeans are one of the winning options for revamping workwear or for creating more casual outfits. This cut is a cross between wide leg and skinny jeans and has been a staple of urban looks for several seasons thanks to its flattering silhouette. Slightly looser at the waist and thighs and narrower at the bottom of the leg, they are ideal for wearing comfortably with trainers, boat shoes, hoodies and all types of casual outfits. The classic blue denim —with lighter and darker washes— includes the regular fit trousers, for those who prefer a loose fit all the way down the leg. These trousers might be the cut that best adapts to every style and shape, as they are one of the most basic and classic cuts. They are simple, discreet and suitable for any occasion. However, if you want to play with creating different looks, the starting point is in the selection of footwear. For more elegant looks, loafers without socks can be a very interesting option. And if the jeans are classic blue denim, you can combine everything from dark brown ankle boots to classic white trainers.\n\nAnd to get the most out of ankle boots, there's nothing quite like pairing them with bootcut jeans. This type of cut was designed specifically to be worn with footwear that makes a statement, however nowadays it has become popular to pair them with casual trainers and a basic T-shirt.\n\nMassimo Dutti offers versions of slim and skinny jeans beyond the classic denim blue. Black or grey jeans can be the ideal base for both casual and smart casual everyday looks. When it comes to skinny jeans, a touch of stretch is added to the fabric for all-day comfort and freedom of movement. Men's white jeans are also a favourite season after season thanks to their ability to create bright, urban looks. The key to wearing them is to give special attention to shoes and opting for neutral colours for the tops.

From straight jeans to slim fit jeans, this Massimo Dutti's denim collection adapts to a variety of men's silhouettes. Denim is at the heart of most men's wardrobe and, for this reason, it is a wardrobe staple.\n\nTapered jeans are one of the winning options for revamping workwear or for creating more casual outfits. This cut is a cross between wide leg and skinny jeans and has been a staple of urban looks for several seasons thanks to its flattering silhouette. Slightly looser at the waist and thighs and narrower at the bottom of the leg, they are ideal for wearing comfortably with trainers, boat shoes, hoodies and all types of casual outfits. The classic blue denim —with lighter and darker washes— includes the regular fit trousers, for those who prefer a loose fit all the way down the leg. These trousers might be the cut that best adapts to every style and shape, as they are one of the most basic and classic cuts. They are simple, discreet and suitable for any occasion. However, if you want to play with creating different looks, the starting point is in the selection of footwear. For more elegant looks, loafers without socks can be a very interesting option. And if the jeans are classic blue denim, you can combine everything from dark brown ankle boots to classic white trainers.\n\nAnd to get the most out of ankle boots, there's nothing quite like pairing them with bootcut jeans. This type of cut was designed specifically to be worn with footwear that makes a statement, however nowadays it has become popular to pair them with casual trainers and a basic T-shirt.\n\nMassimo Dutti offers versions of slim and skinny jeans beyond the classic denim blue. Black or grey jeans can be the ideal base for both casual and smart casual everyday looks. When it comes to skinny jeans, a touch of stretch is added to the fabric for all-day comfort and freedom of movement. Men's white jeans are also a favourite season after season thanks to their ability to create bright, urban looks. The key to wearing them is to give special attention to shoes and opting for neutral colours for the tops. On the other hand, if you are looking for a total white look, a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves will complete the look impeccably.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":1903517,"name":"Suits","nameEn":"Suits","shortDescription":null,"description":"There is no room for debate on how a man should dress well in a suit. If casual style has comfortable jeans and sophisticated chinos leading the way in smart casual, men's dress style only speaks the language of one garment: the suit. Massimo Dutti features sharp suits for men that stand out for their impeccable cut, crafted from the finest fabrics for an unbeatable effect for any occasion.\n\nTailored suits, designed to fit like a glove, are the ultimate expression of masculine elegance and good taste. A great three-piece suit comes to mind when one thinks of those traditional tailoring shops where it all began. However, nowadays a three-piece suit is not essential to earn the title of best dressed. And when a suit is made with the quality and attention to detail that Massimo Dutti is known for, it serves to show self-confidence and reflect the wearer's sophisticated style like no other garment can.\n\nChoosing a smart suit for men is a responsibility and a privilege in equal parts, and getting it right always depends on the degree of smartness of the suit, as well as the time of day and the event's venue. The dress code may call for a morning suit, tailcoat, dinner jacket or perhaps a conventional suit with a tie and polished leather shoes will suffice. Massimo Dutti's collection includes smart men's suits for the workplace or to set the style bar high for those special occasions when no wardrobe detail can be left to chance.\n\nMen's blue suits are always in the spotlight because they never go out of fashion and come in a variety of designs to suit all preferences, including subtle windowpane pattern or the iconic pinstripe, forever associated with the business look. For an elevated daytime look, choose a deeper blue as an alternative to the classic dark tones, although the navy blue men's suit remains one of the most popular styles for its classic elegance and timelessness.\n\nGrey is another favourite suit colour. And a grey suit for men allows for all sorts of combinations, with the shade of grey being what will determine whether it is more appropriate to add a light or dark shirt. The right colour combination can make or break any look, but when it comes to this garment, its relevance is even greater. As an example, a grey suit with a black shirt works best with darker shades of grey, while a suit in a light or medium shade of grey will pair well with a light blue or white shirt.

Furthermore, the varying situations that call for suits with shirts have pushed this garment to adopt a wide range of styles. In Massimo Dutti's selection, all kinds of shirts come together, from a go-to cotton Oxford dress shirt to linen designs whose fabric is a beacon of comfort and freshness even on the warmest days. Regardless of the chosen material, Massimo Dutti's premium quality always remains.\n\nDuring its long history, new interpretations of the collars of men's dress shirts have arisen, and in fact, this has served to expand and enrich this garment's legendary status. Every man's silhouette can be perfectly flattered depending on the type of collar, so Massimo Dutti provides elegant shirts with buttoned-down, Italian, or English collars.\n\nThe white dress shirt is a real life-saver that fits with suits in various colours. However, when it comes to combining shirts with suits, the cuts of every garment are of utmost importance. Precisely because of this, Massimo Dutti's white dress shirt for men embraces slim fits and straighter and looser lines. Once again, each man's body will be the one to have the last word. \n\nOn the other hand, elegant shirts for men aren't just white but can welcome different colours and designs with the most desirable outcomes.

Furthermore, the varying situations that call for suits with shirts have pushed this garment to adopt a wide range of styles. In Massimo Dutti's selection, all kinds of shirts come together, from a go-to cotton Oxford dress shirt to linen designs whose fabric is a beacon of comfort and freshness even on the warmest days. Regardless of the chosen material, Massimo Dutti's premium quality always remains.\n\nDuring its long history, new interpretations of the collars of men's dress shirts have arisen, and in fact, this has served to expand and enrich this garment's legendary status. Every man's silhouette can be perfectly flattered depending on the type of collar, so Massimo Dutti provides elegant shirts with buttoned-down, Italian, or English collars.\n\nThe white dress shirt is a real life-saver that fits with suits in various colours. However, when it comes to combining shirts with suits, the cuts of every garment are of utmost importance. Precisely because of this, Massimo Dutti's white dress shirt for men embraces slim fits and straighter and looser lines. Once again, each man's body will be the one to have the last word. \n\nOn the other hand, elegant shirts for men aren't just white but can welcome different colours and designs with the most desirable outcomes.

Made with the finest materials to deliver that stylish and elegant look","mainHeader":"Suits for Men","longDescription":"There is no room for debate on how a man should dress well in a suit. If casual style has comfortable jeans and sophisticated chinos leading the way in smart casual, men's dress style only speaks the language of one garment: the suit. Massimo Dutti features sharp suits for men that stand out for their impeccable cut, crafted from the finest fabrics for an unbeatable effect for any occasion.\n\nTailored suits, designed to fit like a glove, are the ultimate expression of masculine elegance and good taste. A great three-piece suit comes to mind when one thinks of those traditional tailoring shops where it all began. However, nowadays a three-piece suit is not essential to earn the title of best dressed. And when a suit is made with the quality and attention to detail that Massimo Dutti is known for, it serves to show self-confidence and reflect the wearer's sophisticated style like no other garment can.\n\nChoosing a smart suit for men is a responsibility and a privilege in equal parts, and getting it right always depends on the degree of smartness of the suit, as well as the time of day and the event's venue. The dress code may call for a morning suit, tailcoat, dinner jacket or perhaps a conventional suit with a tie and polished leather shoes will suffice. Massimo Dutti's collection includes smart men's suits for the workplace or to set the style bar high for those special occasions when no wardrobe detail can be left to chance.\n\nMen's blue suits are always in the spotlight because they never go out of fashion and come in a variety of designs to suit all preferences, including subtle windowpane pattern or the iconic pinstripe, forever associated with the business look. For an elevated daytime look, choose a deeper blue as an alternative to the classic dark tones, although the navy blue men's suit remains one of the most popular styles for its classic elegance and timelessness.\n\nGrey is another favourite suit colour. And a grey suit for men allows for all sorts of combinations, with the shade of grey being what will determine whether it is more appropriate to add a light or dark shirt. The right colour combination can make or break any look, but when it comes to this garment, its relevance is even greater. As an example, a grey suit with a black shirt works best with darker shades of grey, while a suit in a light or medium shade of grey will pair well with a light blue or white shirt. Elegance is also a given with a black suit and a blue, white, grey or black shirt.","keywords":null,"secondaryTitle":"Elegant Suits for Men","secondaryDescription":""}},{"id":2147330,"name":"Personal Tailoring","nameEn":"Personal Tailoring","shortDescription":null,"description":"Find the ideal suit in Massimo Dutti's men's tailoring collection.
